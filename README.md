Allows you to regenerate all thumbnails, or just one, after changing the thumbnail sizes bycalling for each image a resize action on the blog.
RegenThumbs Stamina is an alternative version of "Regenerate Thumbnails" developed by Viper007Bond.Link : http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/
== Description ==
RegenThumb Stamina allows you to regenerate the thumbnails for all of your image attachments. This is very handy if you've changed any of your thumbnail dimensions (via Settings -> Media) after previously uploading images. It has been developped mainly by Viper007Bond under the name Regenerate Thumbnails but the plugin lacked of error handling. RegenThumb Stamina is able to continue after an error, and is integrated to Wordpress Media Library, making you able to regenerate the thumbnail of every media once in a while.== Installation ==
